            Welcome! My name is Zainab Shamim. I am a first-year student in the Human-Computer Interaction Master's program at the University of Maryland, College Park. For my undergraduate career, I attended Virginia Tech and graduated a year early with my Bachelor's degree in English Literature, and a minor in Psychology.
            <br>
            <br> In my undergraduate years, I explored different streams of research, some focused on Human-Computer Interaction, and others on English Literature. I hope to continue expanding into the realm of UX Research, and developing my skills with UX Design. I coded this portfolio utilizing HTML and CSS, to share the work from my research and graduate classes.
            <br>
            <br> Thank you kindly for your time.

          <h2>Research: CoDeS Lab</h2>
          <p class="description">
            In the final year of my undergraduate degree I was a research assistant within the <a href="http://kchoi.org/team/" target="_blank">Cognitive Development Science (CoDeS) Lab</a> at Virginia Tech. This lab is dedicated to researching how young children can learn effectively from various technologies and interfaces. Within the CoDeS Lab, I was able to explore new technologies like Eye-Tracking and Conversational AI, and conduct user research in an academic setting to gage our participants' cognitive and academic growth with such interfaces. In April 2023, my team and I were able to present our poster “Are you still watching on your phone or TV? The impact of mobile media on visual attention and learning,” at the <a href="https://www.research.undergraduate.vt.edu/content/research_undergraduate_vt_edu/en/present-and-publish/student-present-and-publish/virginia-tech-conferences/_jcr_content/content/vtmultitab/vt-items_0/download_62211891_co/file.res/2023%20Dennis%20Dean%20Abstract%20Book.pdf " target="_blank">Dennis Dean Undergraduate Research and Creative Scholarship Conference</a>. Our abstract can be found on Page 215.

          <h2>Research: "Of Race and Caste" Publication</h2>
          <p class="description">
            With my love of Shakespeare and my Indian heritage, I was able to write a research paper as a passion project with the help of my faculty advisor, <a href="https://liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-english/faculty/katharine-cleland.html" target="_blank">Dr. Katharine Cleland</a>. This paper is entitled "Of Race and Caste: Discrimination Across Cultures in Shakespeare's <em>Othello</em> and Bhardwaj's <em>Omkara</em>". Within my paper, I explore the implications of Othello as a man of color in Shakespeare's work, and the discrimination he faces throughout the play. I utilize this analysis of Othello as a character to further examine how the Bollywood movie, <em>Omkara</em>, adapts Shakespeare's famous work into the setting of contemporary India, and converts the critique of racism into a critique of casteism. This paper was published in <a href="https://philologia.vt.domains/spring2023/spring-2023/of-race-and-caste-discrimination-across-cultures-in-shakespeares-othello-and-bhardwajs-omkara" target="_blank"><em>Philologia</em></a> in May 2023, and I presented my work at the <a href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2023/04/OUR-ACC-CONFERENCE.html?utm_source=cmpgn_news&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=vtUnirelNewsDailyCMP_042123-fs" target="_blank">ACC Meeting of the Minds</a>, <a href="https://gpss.vt.edu/content/gpss_vt_edu/en/programs/gsars/_jcr_content/content/download/file.res/2023%20GPSS%20Research%20Symposium%20Detailed%20Schedule.pdf" target="_blank">GPSS Research Symposium</a>, and <a href="https://liberalarts.vt.edu/news/academic-news/2023/05/students-presented-at-2023-english-undergraduate-excellence-conference.html" target="_blank">English Undergaduate Excellence Conference</a> in Spring 2023 as well.

          <h2>Graduate Course: User Experience Research</h2>
          <p class="description">
          One of the core classes I am taking for my Master's program is <em>User Experience Research</em>. Within this course, we explored various research methods to aid in gathering data from participants, as well as techniques such as affinity diagraming and modeling. We are currently working on our client projects, where we are aiding the College of Information Sciences in creating a better learning environment for their undergraduate students. Our project focuses on how students interact with their teaching team, which consists of professors, teaching assistants, and graders. Our research consisted of surveys, interviews, and focus groups. Most of our work has been documented on our <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNYnN8Cg=/?share_link_id=962409327030" target="_blank">Miro board</a> and our <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/7X3zsaLRKezpz4syJV9NNS/INST-710%3A-P1-Instructional-Team?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=oNaHtvpdsoCRZL6k-1" target="_blank">Figma file</a>. Our research and final project is still in progress for this semester, but the work we have put into researching, and designing models, has been thorough and exciting.

          <h2>Graduate Courses: Interaction Design</h2>
          <p class="description">
            Another core course that is allowing me to better and enhance my skills within UX design is entitled <em>Interaction Design</em>. This course is has allowed me to explore the skills of paper-prototyping, as well as designing functioning prototypes on Figma. Much of my work from this semester as been documented and produced on my course <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/3uhlVTBXlxJxI5HWhSuiF7/Zainab-%F0%9F%AB%A1?type=design&mode=design&t=Sga6L08hr7G24ZlL-1" target="_blank">Figma file</a>. Our work from this semester has been rooted in group projects where we created scenarios and personas, then formulating our individual app designs around our storyline's universe. These app designs grew from paper prototypes, into low-fidelity wireframes, mid-fidelity wireframes, and a full component library. Our work is still in progress this semester, but this class has truly allowed me to develop my UX Design and interpersonal skills.
