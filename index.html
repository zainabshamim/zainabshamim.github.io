          <h2>The Lyrebirds Podcast: Don't F*ck With Cats</h2>
          <p class="description">Social media popularity is not a rare goal for people to have. But when that popularity is gained from committing brutal crimes against helpless animals, again and again and again, it's more likely than not to gain attention that's negative. Luka Magnotta, cat killer turned murderer, was hunted down by a group of strangers that connected with each other through something as accessible as Facebook. Within <a href="https://soundcloud.com/vndalsavage911/the-lyrebirds-podcast-dont-fck-with-cats?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing" target="_blank">this podcast</a>, my peers and I discuss Magnotta, and the infamous Netflix docuseries centered around him: "Don't Fuck with Cats".</p>
