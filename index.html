            <p class="bio"> Hello World!
            <br>
            <br> My name is Zainab Shamim. I am a first-year student in the Human-Computer Interaction Master's program at the University of Maryland, College Park. For my undergraduate career, I attended Virginia Tech and graduated a year early with my Bachelor's degree in English Literature, and a minor in Psychology.
            <br>
            <br> In my undergraduate years, I explored different streams of research, some focused on Human-Computer Interaction, and others on English Literature. I hope to continue expanding into the realm of UX Research, and developing my skills with UX Design. This portfolio contains work from my research, undergraduate classes, and graduate classes. Thank you for your interest.

          <h2>Research: CoDeS Lab</h2>
          <p class="description">
            In my final year of my undergraduate degree I was a research assistant within the <a href="http://kchoi.org/team/" target="_blank">Cognitive Development Science (CoDeS) Lab</a> at Virginia Tech. This lab is dedicated to researching how young children can learn effectively from various technologies and interfaces. Within the CoDeS Lab, I was able to explore new technologies like Eye-Tracking and Conversational AI, and conduct user research in an academic setting to gage our participants' cognitive and academic growth with such interfaces. In April 2023, my team and I were able to present our poster “Are you still watching on your phone or TV? The impact of mobile media on visual attention and learning,” at the <a href="https://www.research.undergraduate.vt.edu/content/research_undergraduate_vt_edu/en/present-and-publish/student-present-and-publish/virginia-tech-conferences/_jcr_content/content/vtmultitab/vt-items_0/download_62211891_co/file.res/2023%20Dennis%20Dean%20Abstract%20Book.pdf " target="_blank">Dennis Dean Undergraduate Research and Creative Scholarship Conference</a>.

          <h2>Research: <em>Of Race and Caste</em> Paper</h2>
          <p class="description">
            With my love of Shakespeare, and my Indian culture, I was able to write a research paper as a passion project with the help of my faculty advisor, <a href="https://liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-english/faculty/katharine-cleland.html" target="_blank">Dr. Katharine Cleland</a>. This paper is entitled "Of Race and Caste: Discrimination Across Cultures in Shakespeare's <em>Othello</em> and Bhardwaj's <em>Omkara</em>". Within my paper, I explore the implications of Othello as a man of color in Shakespeare's work, and the discrimination he faces throughout the play. I utilize this analysis of Othello as a character to further examine how the Bollywood movie, <em>Omkara</em>, adapts Shakespeare's famous work into the setting of contemporary India, and converts the critique of racism into a critique of casteism. This paper was published in <a href="https://philologia.vt.domains/spring2023/spring-2023/of-race-and-caste-discrimination-across-cultures-in-shakespeares-othello-and-bhardwajs-omkara" target="_blank"><em>Philologia</em></a>, and I was fortunate enough to be able to present my work at the <a href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2023/04/OUR-ACC-CONFERENCE.html?utm_source=cmpgn_news&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=vtUnirelNewsDailyCMP_042123-fs" target="_blank">ACC Meeting of the Minds</a>, <a href="https://gpss.vt.edu/content/gpss_vt_edu/en/programs/gsars/_jcr_content/content/download/file.res/2023%20GPSS%20Research%20Symposium%20Detailed%20Schedule.pdf" target="_blank">GPSS Research Symposium</a>, and <a href="https://liberalarts.vt.edu/news/academic-news/2023/05/students-presented-at-2023-english-undergraduate-excellence-conference.html" target="_blank">English Undergaduate Excellence Conference</a>. </p>
